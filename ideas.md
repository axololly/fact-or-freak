# Ideas

1. Have each lobby spawn a new channel/thread once a game begins, and delete that channel/thread once the game ends

2. Have a statistics page where each user can see the number of questions they've answered, passed, and games they've played in total.

3. Have a `/lives` command so a user can see the number of lives each player has in their lobby.
    - All the data will be present on the database, so this is easily fetchable.

4. Separate all the views into their own files so they're easily readable and accessable.

5. Have a `/guide` command that explains how to play the game.

6. Have an explanation of the inner workings on the `README` of this project.
