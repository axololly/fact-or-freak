# Ideas

1. Have each lobby spawn a new channel/thread once a game begins, and delete that channel/thread once the game ends

2. Have a statistics page where each user can see the number of questions they've answered, passed, and games they've played in total.

3. Have a `/lives` command so a user can see the number of lives each player has in their lobby.
    - All the data will be present on the database, so this is easily fetchable.

4. Separate all the views into their own files so they're easily readable and accessable.
