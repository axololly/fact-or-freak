    title: Setting Custom Prefixes
---

With this bot, you have the option to set custom prefixes for whenever you want to use prefix commands - commands run through sending a message, as opposed to using a `/slash-command`. This can be helpful for if you have a preferred prefix that you want to use or just don't want to learn the bot's default `?` prefix.

To change your prefix, use `[your current prefix]prefix [your new prefix]`. So, for a new user who wants to use `!`, that would be: `?prefix !`. And for them to change back, they can do `!prefix ?` or do `!prefix reset`.

It's that easy.
