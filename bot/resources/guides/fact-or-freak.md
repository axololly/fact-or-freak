    title: Fact or Freak
---

This is the traditional _Truth or Dare_ game I'm sure you're familiar of, but with a far more lewd twist to it. Thanks to a friend of mine who took up the valiant task of cramming the database _full_ of out-of-pocket questions - about 200 or so - we can now play Truth or Dare.

> :memo: **Note:** some of the dares are not possible to answer as text, so if these do arise, just write some random text, then hit `Submit`. The others in the voice call will understand.

Like the notice mentions, this game is meant to be played in a voice chat with friends. Yes: **friends.** (Don't have any? Sucks to suck, loser.)

## Starting a Game

You start by creating a lobby using </play:1319019658497753098> with an optional lobby name, then get your other friends - yes, **friends** - to join in. As the party leader, you can start the game early with the `Start Early`, removing the need to wait for the lobby to close. If not enough people are in the lobby, it will close itself and leave an unhelpful message.

## Playing the Game

Once in, you take it in turns:
1. choosing between `Truth` and `Dare`
2. engaging in the given prompt
3. selecting a person to continue the game

If you fail to respond to any of these, or pass on the prompt, you are given a strike. 3 of these and you get removed from the game.

## Submitting Questions

You can add your own questions, either for everyone or for a specific person, that can be used for any matches going forward. This is achieved by using </submit single:1317871568616947723> for a single question, or </submit multiple:1317871568616947723> for multiple questions.

> </submit multiple:1317871568616947723> will open a text field where you need to write your questions as `<"truth" or "dare"> - <question text here>` to be understood by the parser.
